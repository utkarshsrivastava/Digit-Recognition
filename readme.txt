Project 1- CSE574 Introduction to Machine Learning

To view the results, run the project1.m file wich imports the project1_data.mat file and the respective functions being train_cfs, test_cfs for the closed form solution method and train_gd, test_gd for the gradient decent method.
The results for both are displayed when program1.m file is executed. 

To vary the parameter, change the value of lambda_cfs on line 12 in program1.m file. The M values are iteratively computed from M=1 to M=30 to output the most optimum solution. 

NOTE: The computation of mean and variance has been randomized and the technique illustrated in the project report. For best results run the program several times and take the average of results obtained in all runs. The results published in the report have been done this way. 

For GD method, the error is caclulated in a similar fashion by running the program iteratively for the value of M=1 to 25. This is done inside the train_gd,test_gd functions. It is advisable to keep the upper bound of M=25 in the GD method for accurate results. Averages obtained over multiple runs will better indicate the optimum values like the previous case. 


Mu_cfs,Mu_gd, S_cfs,S_gd, W_cfs,W_gd have provided which are the respective mean, variance of weights learnt by the closed form and gradient descent technique.
